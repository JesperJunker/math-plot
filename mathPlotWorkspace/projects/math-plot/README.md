# MathPlot

This library is for plotting mathematical functions.
One can plot the formula in between a start and end for x in polar or cartesian coordinates.

## Notes

- This once also had a part to render the functions in pretty. This is now split into a seperate library, called @jesperjunker/formula-ui
